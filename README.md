# ascii_shooter

(made in 2015)
A simple shooter game with ASCII graphics. Made with pure C using code::blockls IDE. The goal of this project was to get used with C language - structures, 
methods, pointer handling, file handling (you can save the game and leaderboards) - and some user interaction.
